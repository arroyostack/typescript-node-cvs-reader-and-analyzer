## Overview

This repository serves as a companion for the tutorial on building a CSV reader and analyzer with TypeScript and Node.js. The tutorial covers various key concepts and practices in TypeScript and Node.js development. Below is a quick recap of the important topics covered in the tutorial:

### Enum and Tuples

- Created an enum to represent insight into match results.
- Explored the use of tuples to describe a single row of a CSV file.
- Demonstrated the practical application of tuples for type conversions.

### Inheritance and Generics

- Introduced an abstract class, `CSVFileReader`, as a generic class.
- Briefly discussed generics and their role in configuring types dynamically.
- Showcased the usage of generics when extending `CSVFileReader` in the `MatchReader` class.

### Composition

- Explored composition as an alternative to inheritance.
- Illustrated examples of composition in the `MatchReader` and `SummaryNotes` classes.
- Highlighted the benefits of composition over inheritance.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a practical comparison between inheritance and composition, emphasizing the advantages of composition in certain scenarios. While the project was extensive, the goal was to offer a hands-on experience with TypeScript and Node.js development.
